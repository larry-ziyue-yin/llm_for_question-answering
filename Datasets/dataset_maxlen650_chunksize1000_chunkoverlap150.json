        "You are required to meet with your advisor each semester before class registration and before you declare a major. Your advisor might arrange additional advising sessions throughout the semesters. You are also encouraged to be in touch with your advisor and reach out any time you have questions or concerns.",
        "You may declare a major in the Spring term of your sophomore year. All students must secure formal approval of their long-range plans and declare a major no later than the last teaching day of the first seven-week session in their fourth semester. Until that time, students should be exploring different options of majors to ensure that they are making the best choice for themselves. Students who do not declare their major may be prevented from registering for classes for their fifth undergraduate semester and from participating in a semester or study abroad program. Information related to declaring your major will be provided in the 3rd 7-week session of the Sophomore year. Please refer to the Office of Undergraduate Advising if you have questions about the major declaration.",
        "Step 1: Prepare to declare by identifying an intended major and planning a pathway to graduation. Step 2: Advisor Meeting. Step 3: Major Declaration Application Form.",
        "Yes, but before you do so, please refer to the UG Bulletin and the DKU Degree Requirement Sheet about the new major requirements and work out a new 4-year graduation plan. This kind of planning is to make sure that you can graduate on time. The next step is to consult your academic advisor about the new major and your plan. After that, you can request to change your major by submitting a form to the Office of the University Registrar. Major Change Form may be found on the Registrar's website under \"Student Forms\" (https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/about/student-records-and-resources/). No changes in majors can be made after the end of the Drop/Add period of the first session of the Fall term in the senior year. Every change of major request is subject to review and is not guaranteed approval.",
        "General Education (3 common core courses (12 credits); 2-4 language courses (8-16 credits); 3 courses as distribution requirements (12 credits); 1 quantitative reasoning course (4 credits)); Major(Divisional foundation courses; Interdisciplinary; Disciplinary; Signature work); Electives; Other requirements(1 non-credit mini-term; 1 Signature work product).",
        "The common core courses provide opportunities for students to develop a degree of common knowledge and shared experience. They focus on big questions and critical challenges which every student should prepare to engage. They also focus on writing and speaking and aim to develop communication skills over time. The common core courses are GCHINA 101 - China In the World (Year 1), GLOCHALL 201 - Global Challenges in Science, Technology, and Health (Year 2), and ETHLDR 201 - Ethics, Citizenship and the Examined Life (Year 3).",
        "The distribution requirement is intended to broaden students’ educational experience and ensure that all graduates have an acquaintance with a broad variety of knowledge fields. Students are required to take at least one 4-credit course in each of the three divisional areas: Arts and Humanities (AH), Natural and Applied Sciences (NAS), and Social Sciences (SS). When searching for courses, you may specify the “Course Attribute” to “Division” in the search criteria, where you can further specify AH, NAS, or SS. Please note that courses with two divisional attributes can only be counted towards one  area attribute. Put another way, you cannot use one class for two distribution requirements even if the course has both attributes.",
        "The Quantitative Reasoning (QR) requirement aims to ensure that all students graduate with critical skills in quantitative analysis and deductive reasoning. QR requirements can be fulfilled by taking a course with a QR attribute or by approved transfer credit from study abroad or summer programs for computer science, mathematics, or statistics courses. QR requirements can also be fulfilled by AP or IPC credits. More detailed information on qualified AP or IPC credits can be found in the Quantitative Reasoning Course Requirement section of the UG Bulletin.",
        "8 to 16 credits of language courses are required for all students. All students will be assigned to the EAP (English for Academic Purposes) Track or CSL (Chinese as a Second Language) Track based on students’ secondary education language medium. For the EAP track, students are required to take EAP 101A,101B, and EAP 102A, 102B. WOC is available for students to develop advanced English writing and oral communication skills. For the CSL track, students without any previous Chinese training are required to take CHINESE 101,102, 201, and 202. Students who have previous Chinese knowledge and are placed in a higher level Chinese class still need to take 8 credits of Chinese classes starting with and including whatever level course they are placed into. That is to say, students who begin their Chinese study in CHINESE 101A are required to take Chinese courses until they complete CHINESE 202B; students who begin studying Chinese in CHINESE 201A or a higher level course are required to take 8 credits, starting with and including whatever level course they are placed into.",
        "All students must earn 34 credits from courses taught or co-taught by Duke faculty. These courses can be taken at DKU as well as at Duke. Depending on whether a student studies at Duke, there are 3 possible options for completing the Duke credit requirement: Option A: Summer (8 credits) + Semester (16 credits) at Duke + 10 credits at DKU over 4 years; Option B: Semester (16 credits) at Duke + 18 credits at DKU over 4 years; Option C: 34 credits at DKU over 4 years (take courses with DINS code). Students who are likely to pursue Option A or Option B will need to take 3-5 courses from Duke faculty who are teaching at DKU over a 4-year period. Students who pursue Option C will need to work carefully with their advisor and the Office of Undergraduate Advising to identify courses every year that are taught by Duke faculty and that fit their interests and fulfill the requirements for their general education and major requirements. The Duke faculty recruitment is an ongoing process, and courses taught by Duke faculty are identified in the SIS system. There are occasions in which the Duke designation may change, such as instructor changes that are out of the control of DKU. Signature Work hours may also count towards this. For students with a mentor who holds a Duke appointment, this happens automatically, for those who have other mentors and are short on DINS credit as they approach graduation they can request their Division Chair as a co-mentor as long as they do it before both courses are taken.",
        "Additional requirements by the Ministry of Education of China for Mainland Chinese and HMT students are the following: 16 credits of Chinese Society and Culture (CHSC) courses; 8 credits of PE course; 2 credits (Class of 2022) / 4 credits (Class of 2023 and Beyond) of Military Training (Note that HMT students may substitute the military training credits with credits from specifically designated Chinese studies courses.); Passing the physical proficiency test set by the Ministry of Education of China.",
        "Yes. CHSC courses are optional for international students. Students should note that the Chinese Society and Culture courses are taught in Chinese and do not count toward the 136 credits for the DKU degree.",
        "Although you may still be exploring and do not plan to declare your major until the Spring of your sophomore year, you should consult with your advisor to plan ahead. While there is no specific course or credit requirement that must be completed prior to declaring your major in your sophomore year, be mindful of course sequencing when considering your major pathway to stay on track to graduation. If you are interested in Arts and Humanities and Social Sciences majors, you should plan to complete the 2 divisional foundation courses and 5-6 (100-200 level) disciplinary or interdisciplinary major courses by the end of your sophomore year. If you are interested in Natural and Applied Sciences majors, you should plan to complete the 5 divisional foundation courses plus any remaining 100-level and most or all of the 200-level disciplinary and interdisciplinary major courses by the end of the sophomore year. You can refer to the Course Planning Sheet for more information/suggestions on course sequencing.",
        "Yes. You may drop and add courses during the Drop/Add period. Courses dropped during this period do not appear on the official Duke Kunshan transcript. After the Drop/ Add period, no courses may be added, but you may still withdraw from a class with the permission of your academic advisor. Courses withdrawn will receive a designation of W on the academic record. For more information about course withdrawal, please refer to the Registration section on the UG Bulletin.",
        "This depends on the question or concern. Students should consult the Office of the Registrar at DKU-registrar@dukekunshan.edu.cn if they want to celebrate, voice concerns, or have questions related to the registration process or if they have trouble with SIS. If the question is policy related you can reach out to Academic Advising at advising@dukekunshan.edu.cn. For questions about whether or not a class is working for a student's degree please see your academic advisor or view your Advising Report/What-if Report in SIS.",
        "The normal course load is 16-20 credits per semester (8-10 credits in each 7-week session). As a freshman, you are registered for a maximum of 8 credits for the first session of the first semester. In addition, you may enroll in up to one credit of PE courses without special permission from your advisor. You should be reminded that it is your responsibility to be certain that the courses selected and overall load are aligned with academic requirements. For detailed information on course load, please see the Undergraduate Course Load section of the UG Bulletin.",
        "Students on academic probation may register for no more than 16 credits plus one PE course.",
        "Overload is defined as enrolling in more than 10 credits in a 7-week session or more than 20 credits in a semester, exclusive of PE, up to 24 credits. The request form can be found on the Registrar’s Website under student forms. Students need special permission from both their academic advisor and the Dean of Undergraduate Studies to enroll in an overload.",
        "A course load between 12 and 15 credits is considered a course underload. There are two categories of underload: withdrawal to underload (when a course is withdrawn) and enrollment to underload (when you never signed up for 16 hours to begin with). The maximum number of underloads is two-semester (medical withdrawals are not counted in this number), and there are only two possible enrollment scenarios involving 2 underloads: One withdrawal to an underload plus one enrollment in an underload, or Two enrollments in an underload. Seniors needing only 3 courses to graduate may request a part-time degree status for their last semester and it is not affected by the underload policies described here.",
        "An underload may affect a student’s scholarship or ability to graduate on time. Students taking an underload will be ineligible for the Dean’s list and the Dean’s list with Distinction during that semester. You should not count on an overload later to compensate for a previous underload.",
        "The request form can be found on the Registrar’s Website under student forms. Students need special permission from both their academic advisor and the Dean of Undergraduate Studies to enroll in an underload. For the specific policies and criteria on the underloads, please refer to the UG Bulletin sections titled Underload, Withdrawing to an Underload, and Enrollment in an Underload.",
        "To withdraw from a class after the Drop/Add period, you must first obtain permission from your academic advisor. Then you can withdraw from a class by submitting a Course Withdrawal Form, which can be found on the Registrar’s Website, under Student Records and Resources. Withdrawing from a class is permitted in multiple Fall/ Spring semesters, as long as a course load of 16 credits is maintained. Withdrawal to an underload (fewer than 16 hours) is only permitted once.",
        "Yes, such courses receive a designation of W on your academic record.",
        "The deadline for requesting withdrawal from a course in a Fall/ Spring semester is four weeks before the last day of classes for fourteen-week courses and two weeks before the last day of classes for seven-week courses. You can refer to the Academic Calendar for the withdrawal deadline date. The deadline applies to course withdrawals for any reason other than medical.",

The CR/NC form can be found on the DKU Registrar’s website under Student Records and Resources. Note that once you have notified the registrar to change the grading basis to CR/NC, you may not change it back to a regular grade, please see the detailed policy in the UG bulletin.",
        "If you received a grade of C- or better in the course, you’ll receive a CR (Credit). If you received a grade of D+ or below in the course, you’ll receive an NC (No Credit).",
        "For the Class of 2022 to 2024: You may elect to CR/NC a course at any time up until the end of the Drop/Add period of the first session of the subsequent semester in which you are enrolled. Drop/Add period can be found on the Academic Calendar on the Registrar’s Website. For the Class of 2025 and beyond: You may elect to CR/NC a course at any time up until the course withdrawal deadline of the session in which you take the course. Withdrawal deadline can be found on the Academic Calendar on the Registrar's Website.",
        "In total, no more than 16 credits towards the 136 credits may be taken on a Credit/ No Credit basis. This limit doesn’t apply to courses that are only offered on a CR/NC basis. For the Class of 2022 to 2024: In the first year (two semesters), you may use up to eight of the sixteen CR/NC credits, up to a maximum of 4 credits per semester. For the Class of 2025 and beyond: You may elect up to 4 credits per session.",
        "In your first two semesters, you may CR/NC any course. Courses taken on a CR/NC basis from the 3rd semester onward (except those courses offered only on this basis, CHINESE 201 A-B, and CHINESE 202 A-B) DO NOT count toward general education requirements (common core, distribution, quantitative reasoning, language courses other than CHINESE 201 A-B & 202 A-B), degree requirements, or as prerequisites, unless by special permission from the Office of Undergraduate Studies.",
        "NC is considered as a failing grade; To retake a course with an NC grade, you need permission from your academic advisor before registering for the same course a second time. You may NOT repeat a course for which the grade is CR, regardless of what the original grade was. The student should appeal in writing to their academic advisor, who will make a recommendation to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, whose decision is final.",
        "In determining whether a student should be placed on academic warning, probation, or suspended for academic reasons, a grade of NC earned in a course (other than PE course), whether that course is offered only on the CR/NC basis or the student elects to take it on the CR/NC basis, is considered equivalent to a grade of F.",
        "No. The PE course is only offered on a CR/NC basis.",
        "You CANNOT utilize CR/NC policy if you drop/withdraw to an underload in the semester. You must enroll in a normal load of courses (16 credits) to be approved to CR/NC a course.

        "If you are studying at Duke University, you may take courses on a Duke Satisfactory/ Unsatisfactory (S/U) basis following Duke’s processes, regulations, and deadlines. These courses will be transferred back to DKU using DKU’s CR/NC system. Note that students who use S/U on a Duke course that could not be transferred over as CR/NC at DKU will not earn credits for the course and may be ineligible to retake the course at either institution. If you are studying at a university other than Duke University, you may not receive credit for courses taken on a CR/NC (or Pass/ Fail or Satisfactory/ Unsatisfactory) basis.",
        "If, because of illness, emergency, or circumstances outside your reasonable control, you cannot complete work for a course or cannot attend the final examination, you may request in writing to the instructor the assignment of an I (incomplete) for the course. An incomplete grade will not be authorized if the student has a history of excessive absences or failure to coursework in a timely fashion.",
        "You must satisfactorily complete the work by the last class day (Thursday) of the fifth week of the subsequent regular session except when an earlier deadline has been established by the instructor. An earlier deadline might be established when you apply to study abroad. An I grade assigned in the summer must be resolved in the succeeding fall term.
