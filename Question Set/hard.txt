# When can I declare a major?
You may declare a major in the Spring term of your sophomore year. All students must secure formal approval of their long-range plans and declare a major no later than the last teaching day of the first seven-week session in their fourth semester. Until that time, students should be exploring different options of majors to ensure that they are making the best choice for themselves. Students who do not declare their major may be prevented from registering for classes for their fifth undergraduate semester and from participating in a semester or study abroad program. Information related to declaring your major will be provided in the 3rd 7-week session of the Sophomore year. Please refer to the Office of Undergraduate Advising if you have questions about the major declaration.

# What are the required language courses?
8 to 16 credits of language courses are required for all students. All students will be assigned to the EAP (English for Academic Purposes) Track or CSL (Chinese as a Second Language) Track based on students’ secondary education language medium. For the EAP track, students are required to take EAP 101A,101B, and EAP 102A, 102B. WOC is available for students to develop advanced English writing and oral communication skills. For the CSL track, students without any previous Chinese training are required to take CHINESE 101,102, 201, and 202. Students who have previous Chinese knowledge and are placed in a higher level Chinese class still need to take 8 credits of Chinese classes starting with and including whatever level course they are placed into. That is to say, students who begin their Chinese study in CHINESE 101A are required to take Chinese courses until they complete CHINESE 202B; students who begin studying Chinese in CHINESE 201A or a higher level course are required to take 8 credits, starting with and including whatever level course they are placed into.

# What's Duke 34? How many credits must I earn from courses taught by Duke faculty and what are my options for doing so?
All students must earn 34 credits from courses taught or co-taught by Duke faculty. These courses can be taken at DKU as well as at Duke. Depending on whether a student studies at Duke, there are 3 possible options for completing the Duke credit requirement: Option A: Summer (8 credits) + Semester (16 credits) at Duke + 10 credits at DKU over 4 years; Option B: Semester (16 credits) at Duke + 18 credits at DKU over 4 years; Option C: 34 credits at DKU over 4 years (take courses with DINS code). Students who are likely to pursue Option A or Option B will need to take 3-5 courses from Duke faculty who are teaching at DKU over a 4-year period. Students who pursue Option C will need to work carefully with their advisor and the Office of Undergraduate Advising to identify courses every year that are taught by Duke faculty and that fit their interests and fulfill the requirements for their general education and major requirements. The Duke faculty recruitment is an ongoing process, and courses taught by Duke faculty are identified in the SIS system. There are occasions in which the Duke designation may change, such as instructor changes that are out of the control of DKU. Signature Work hours may also count towards this. For students with a mentor who holds a Duke appointment, this happens automatically, for those who have other mentors and are short on DINS credit as they approach graduation they can request their Division Chair as a co-mentor as long as they do it before both courses are taken.

# How do I request a Medical Leave of Absence?
A medical leave of absence request can be granted at any time with proper medical documentation and a leave of absence request form. You must provide a diagnosis from a Level II hospital or above or a recommendation from a licensed psychological counselor to the Campus Health Services and Counseling and Psychological Services. For physical health reasons: If you received treatment at the DKU Clinic, the attending physician should fill in the Healthcare Provider's Recommendation Form for you to submit, along with your LOA application form, to UG Studies. If you were seen by an external physician at a Level II hospital or above, you should ask for diagnosis and relevant medical records for submission to DKU physicians via campushealth@dukekunshan.edu.cn, who will verify the materials and inform the student and UG Studies of the result in writing. For mental health reasons: If you received a course of treatment at DKU CAPS, your therapist will fill out the Healthcare Provider's Recommendation Form (if the therapist supports the student’s MLOA) for the student to submit, along with your LOA application form, to UG Studies. If you are seen by an external mental health provider, you should work with the provider to fill out the External Healthcare Provider's Recommendation Form for the student to submit, along with your LOA application form, to UG Studies. The leave of absence request form can be found in the Registrar’s Office at https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/en/registrar-office/student-records. 

# How do I return from Leave of Absence?
You must submit a Return from Leave of Absence Application and receive approval to return from any type of leave of absence, including suspension or involuntary leave of absence. The Return from Leave of Absence Application form can be found on the Registrar’s Office Website. The deadlines for this application, including all supporting materials, are 5:00 p.m. May 1 (BJT) for Fall Semester and 5:00 p.m. October 15 (BJT) for Spring Semester. Late or incomplete applications will not be accepted.

# What is considered Academic Probation?
For the Class of 2022 to 2024: For students enrolled in a normal course load (16 or more credits), the following scenarios will put you in Academic Probation standing: In the first semester of the freshman, you received DD, DF, and FF. In any other semesters, you received DDD, DF, or FF. During two consecutive semesters, you received DDDD, DDDF, or DDFF. For students enrolled in authorized underload (fewer than 16 credits): In the first semester of the freshman, you received DD, F. In any other semesters, you received DDD or DF. During two consecutive semesters, you received DDDD, DDDF, or DDFF. All students should pass at least 12 credits; students who fail to pass 12 credits do not meet the semester continuation requirement and thus are subject to academic suspension. For the Class of 2025 and beyond At the end of each fall and spring semester, failure to meet a 2.0 GPA (either a term GPA or a cumulative GPA) will result in academic probation for the following semester. 

# What should I do if I am placed on academic probation?
You must acknowledge your probationary status to the Office of Undergraduate Studies in writing to continue at the university. In most cases, this acknowledgment will go through Academic Advising, which is part of Undergraduate Studies. You are required to meet with the Director of Academic Advising before the Drop/Add deadline. You will be matched with an Academic Success Coach and are expected to meet with them periodically. You are also expected to seek assistance from other campus resources and meet with your academic advisor periodically. You are expected to clear your probationary status during the semester of probation.

# How do I clear my probationary status?
You must enroll in 16 credits (plus up to one PE credit), of which no more than 4 credits may be taken on a Credit/ No Credit basis. Probationary status cannot be cleared the semester which you withdraw to underload. For the Class of 2022 to 2024: A grade of C, CR, or better must be earned in each course, or a C average (GPA 2.0) must be achieved in that semester. Note that if you received a C average (GPA 2.0) for the semester but have a grade combination that would result in academic probation, you will continue your probationary status through the next semester of enrollment. For the Class of 2025 and beyond: You must achieve a term and cumulative GPA of at least 2.0.

# Can I transfer credits from the college-level courses that I took prior to coming to DKU?
